# DevOps Project Checklist â€“ CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Initial Setup and Planning

- [ ] Choose Cloud Provider (AWS/Azure)
- [ ] Set up project management board (Trello/Jira/GitHub Projects)

## Automated CI/CD Pipeline Setup

### Jenkins Installation

- [ ] Install Jenkins on a server or use Jenkins in a Docker container
- [ ] Configure Jenkins for access
- [ ] Install necessary plugins (e.g., Git, Docker, Kubernetes plugins)

### Jenkins Configuration Scripts

- [ ] Write configuration scripts for Jenkins jobs
- [ ] Include scripts for building, testing, and deploying applications

### Version Control

- [ ] Create a GitHub repository for code and scripts
- [ ] Implement branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow)

## Containerization with Docker

### Dockerfile Creation

- [ ] Write Dockerfiles for application(s)
- [ ] Optimize and secure Docker images

### Docker Compose (if needed)

## Kubernetes Deployment

### Kubernetes Cluster Setup

- [ ] Set up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS (EKS) or Azure (AKS)

### Kubernetes Manifests

- [ ] Create deployment manifests (`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, etc.)

## CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
### Pipeline Configuration
- [ ] Configure Jenkins pipelines (using Jenkinsfile)
- [ ] Automate build, test, and deployment processes

### Integration with GitHub
- [ ] Set up webhooks in GitHub to trigger Jenkins pipelines on code push events

### Deployment to Kubernetes
- [ ] Automate deployment of Docker containers to Kubernetes cluster through Jenkins

## Documentation
### User Guide
- [ ] Write a user guide explaining setup and use of the CI/CD pipeline

### Architecture Diagrams
- [ ] Create diagrams showing pipeline architecture and deployment flow

### Contribution Guidelines
- [ ] Provide guidelines for future developers

## Project Management
### Task Tracking
- [ ] Track tasks, progress, and milestones on the project management board

### Regular Updates
- [ ] Regularly update the board with task status and blockers

## Deliverables Preparation
### Video Creation
- [ ] Record a 5-minute video explaining the project
  - [ ] Explain the project board
  - [ ] Discuss components
  - [ ] Demonstrate the working system

### Documentation Package
- [ ] Prepare a PDF copy of the README
- [ ] Include a link/invitation to the project repo

## Tools Required
### Pipeline and Deployment
- [ ] AWS or Azure
- [ ] Jenkins

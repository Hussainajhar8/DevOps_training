# DevOps Project Checklist â€“ CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Initial Setup and Planning

- [x] Choose Cloud Provider (AWS/Azure)
- [x] Set up project management board (Trello/Jira/GitHub Projects)

## Automated CI/CD Pipeline Setup

### Jenkins Installation

- [x] Install Jenkins on a server or use Jenkins in a Docker container
- [ ] Configure Jenkins for access
- [ ] Install necessary plugins (e.g., Git, Docker, Kubernetes plugins)

### Jenkins Configuration Scripts

- [x] Write configuration scripts for Jenkins jobs
- [x] Include scripts for building, testing, and deploying applications

### Version Control

- [x] Create a GitHub repository for code and scripts
- [x] Implement branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow)

## Containerization with Docker

### Dockerfile Creation

- [x] Write Dockerfiles for application(s)
- [ ] Optimize and secure Docker images

### Docker Compose (if needed)

### Kubernetes Manifests

- [x] Create deployment manifests (`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, etc.)

## CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

### Pipeline Configuration

- [ ] Configure Jenkins pipelines (using Jenkinsfile)
- [ ] Automate build, test, and deployment processes

### Integration with GitHub

## Deliverables Preparation

### Video Creation

- [ ] Record a 5-minute video explaining the project
  - [ ] Explain the project board
  - [ ] Discuss components
  - [ ] Demonstrate the working system

### Documentation Package

- [ ] Prepare a PDF copy of the README
